<img src="https://diriectordoc.github.io/img/Example-DocBot.png" height=250 alt="Doc Bot" />

This image uses a partially similar depiction of a Mii (copyright Nintendo). Although this imagery can be considered a parody, and therefore falls under "Fair Dealing" in Canada and somewhat meets "Fair Use" rights in the United States, I will not be releasing this image under any license and I do not recommend this image be used for personal use.

This logo image consists only of simple geometric shapes or text. It does not meet the threshold of originality needed for copyright protection and is therefore in the public domain.
